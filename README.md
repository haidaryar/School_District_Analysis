# School District Analysis.

## Overview

Due to reported academic dishonesty of Thomas High Schools 9th graders, I was required to change the data as well the code for the analysis.  To better analyze the data, the following changes were made to the dataset. 

 - Reading scores for Thomas High School 9th graders were change to 'Nan' values. 
 - Math scores for Thomas High School 9th graders  were change to 'Nan' values. 

### Changes to code and metrics

- Percentages in the 'district_summary_df' didn't change signficantly. Changes that show in the said DataFrame are by 0.01%. Please see relevant accompanying images for details. 
- Initially Thomas High School's percentage for passing math, percentage for passing reading, and overall passing percentage dropped by approximately 27%, 28%, and 25% respectively. However, those values were changed with percentages based off of new calculation. Values were replaced using the loc method. 
- It is important to note that Thomas High School's ranking didn't change.
